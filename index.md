# Welcome!

Thanks for stopping by! This website was made to make it as straightforward as possible to install FireWorks (made by the Materials Project) and other relevant dependencies on USC HPC clusters and other systems with similar architecture. Before we start, have a quick look at the [FireWorks front page](https://materialsproject.github.io/fireworks/) so you can familiarize yourself with what we're about to install.

Arguably, you could go through the main FireWorks tutorial for installation, but there are certain caveats and exceptions that it doesn't account for, and I had to go through trial and error just to probe what worked and what didn't. With this, you hopefully won't have to go through all of that.

This website is very much a WIP, so if you catch anything that might be a mistake or anything that you'd feel would be helpful to include, do not hesitate to contact me at quiton[at]usc.edu. This website is also hosted on GitHub pages, so feel free to fork it and create a page that you think would be helpful.

With that out of the way, [lets get started!](./pages/FW1-PythonInst.html) Or you can use the sidebar at the left for a specific page. Also, in each part we will be creating scripts and other files we need to get through the tutorial. You can make them yourself, or, if you access the GitHub repository I used to create this website, you'll find a folder called `/tutorial_docs` which contains all the files for each part for copy/pasting.
